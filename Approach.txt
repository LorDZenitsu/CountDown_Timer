
Here is step-by-step approach to creating a countdown timer using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

First HTML Structuring:-

1.First create an HTML file (index.html).
2.Include input fields for minutes using <input> elements.
3.Add buttons for "Play," "Pause," and "Reset" using <button> elements.
4.Display the countdown timer in a <div> element.

Now CSS Styling:
1.Create a CSS file (styles.css) for styling.
2.Style the container to center the content using display: flex and justify-content: center.
3.Customize the appearance of the countdown timer (#timer) for better readability.
4. Use proper Font size and font weight for proper apperance.

Finally JavaScript functionality:
1.Create a JavaScript file (script.js) to handle functionality.
2.Implement variables to store the countdown interval, and a boolean flag for pausing the countdown.
3.Attach event listeners to the "Play," "Pause," and "Reset" buttons.
4.Add functionality to buttons.

Countdown Start:
1.Retrieve input values for minutes(minutesInput).
2.Calculate the total seconds based on the input values.
3.Use setInterval to decrement the timer and update the display accordingly.
4.Handle the case where the timer reaches zero.

Countdown Pause:

1.Toggle the boolean flag (paused) to control whether the countdown should proceed.
2.Ensure that the countdown interval continues updating while paused.
3.Use resume button to resume the timer.

Countdown Reset:
1.Clear the interval to stop the countdown.
2.Reset the timer display to the initial state.
3.Reset any variables used for tracking the countdown.

Things to Ensure:
1.Validate input values to ensure they are non-negative integers and non-empty(not a null value).
2.Format the displayed time for better user experience (e.g., HH:MM:SS).
3.Consider user interactions and provide appropriate feedback, such as disabling buttons during certain states.
4.If user changes input value then reset the timer.
